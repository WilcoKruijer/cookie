# Specs Feature

- Suggested commit scopes in `specs/COMMIT.md` are project-specific and should be adjusted per repo.
- `specs/INDEX.md` is repo-specific. Keep it out of templates and have `specs/README.md` explain how
  to create it when missing.
- `specs/references/.gitkeep` is a placeholder that only has to exist if there are no other files in
  that directory. If the directory has other files, it does NOT have to be created.
